            Thanksgiving is a cherished national holiday celebrated primarily in
            the United States and Canada, centered on the themes of gratitude
            and harvest. In the U.S., it is observed on the fourth Thursday of
            November, its origins often traced to a 1621 feast shared between
            the Plymouth colonists and the Wampanoag people to celebrate a
            successful harvest. The holiday is characterized by family and
            friends gathering for a large, traditional meal. This feast famously
            includes a roasted turkey as the centerpiece, accompanied by dishes
            like stuffing, mashed potatoes, gravy, cranberry sauce, and pumpkin
            pie. Beyond the food, Thanksgiving is synonymous with specific
            traditions, such as watching the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade,
            attending high school football games, or watching professional games
            on television. At its core, however, the day remains a time for
            reflection. It provides a formal opportunity for individuals and
            families to pause, come together, and express gratitude for their
            blessings, health, and relationships from the preceding year,
            marking the warm prelude to the winter holiday season.

                Beyond the meal, Thanksgiving is a major cultural event. The day
                often begins with watching the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade,
                famous for its giant balloons and performances. It is also
                synonymous with American football, as families gather to watch
                professional games. For many, the holiday serves as a time for
                reflection and marks the official start of the winter holiday
                season.

              <h3>History</h3>
              <p>
                Thanksgiving recalls a 1621 feast shared between the Plymouth
                colonists and the Wampanoag people, celebrating the settlers'
                first successful harvest in the New World. This event symbolized
                cooperation and survival. While the historical details are
                complex, this harvest meal established the holiday's central
                themes: gratitude, partnership, and acknowledging the bounty of
                the preceding year.
